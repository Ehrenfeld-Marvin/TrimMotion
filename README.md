# Trim Method for Cycloidal Rotors

The current state of the art computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations regarding cycloidal rotors work with pre-imposed pitching functions. This does not allow to study the behaviour in a chosen flight condition. This code includes how a trim method can be implemented inside the simulation software OpenFOAM to adjust the controller of a rotor during a simulation. This function uses a control system, consisting of two PID-controller, with the objective to adjust the amount and the direction of lift. One controller will adjust the amplitude of the rotor's motion equation which tunes the amount of lift. The second controller adjusts the phase shift inside the motion equation to tune the direction of lift. During the simulation, each of these parameters will be calculated after one complete rotation until the desired flight condition is achieved.
